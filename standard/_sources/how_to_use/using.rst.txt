Using a code that already implements the PICMI standard
=======================================================

.. warning::

   This section is currently in development.


Codes that adopt the PICMI standard use use a Python script as an input.
This script uses a common set of objects that each code implements.

Here is an example of input script:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../Examples/laser_acceleration/laser_acceleration_PICMI.py
    :language: python
